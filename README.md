# What's this?
You can create automatically AWS CloudFront invalidation by groups.

# Why made this?
If you create many invalidations, sometime you fail to create invalidation because there is too target paths.
in such case, you have to divided into a few times and create invalidation, but it's stress you need to confirm previous status each time.

# Usage
TODO

I can say for now is that using JSON might be easier than specifying some flags.
